I have this thing where I get older, but just never wiser	Baby love, I think I've been a little too kind	No words appear before me in the aftermath	Dear reader, if it feels like a trap	We were supposed to be just friends	Lock broken, slur spoken	You're talking shit for the hell of it	"It only hurts this much right now"	Meet me at midnight	When the morning came	Once upon a time, the planets and the fates	Rain	"Your ex-friend's sister	I remember	One night, a few moons ago	I spy with my little tired eye	My knuckles were bruised like violets	Draw the cat eye sharp enough to kill a man	If you would've blinked, then I would've	Summer went away, still, the yearning stays
Midnights become my afternoons	Didn't notice you walkin' all over my peace of mind	Salt streams out my eyes and into my ears	You're already in one	You don't live in my part of town, but maybe I'll see you out some weekend	Wound open, game token	Addicted to betrayal, but you're relevant	Was what I was thinkin' the whole time		We were cleaning incense off your vinyl shelf	And all the stars aligned	He wanted it comfortable, I wanted that pain	Met someone at a club and he kissed her		I saw flecks of what could've been lights	Tiny as a firefly	Sucker punching walls, cursed you as I sleep-talked	You did some bad things, but I'm the worst of them	Looked away at the first glance	I play it cool with the best of them
When my depression works the graveyard shift, all of the people	In the shoes I gave you as a present	Every single thing I touch becomes sick with sadness	Dear reader, get out your map	Depending on what kind of mood and situationship I'm in	I didn't know you were keeping count	You're terrified to look down	Breathe in, breathe through, breathe deep, breathe out	[Verse 1]	'Cause we lost track of time again	You and I ended up in the same room	He wanted a bride, I was making my own name	Turns out, it was that guy you hooked up with ages ago	[Verse 1]	But it might just have been you	A pebble that we picked up last July	Spineless in my tomb of silence	Sometimes I wonder which one'll be your last lie	If you tasted poison, you could've	I wait patiently, he's gonna notice me
I've ghosted stand there in the room	Puttin' someone first only works when you're in their top five	'Cause it's all over now, all out to sea	Pick somewhere and just run	And what's in my system	Rain soaking, blind hoping	'Cause if you dare, you'll see the glare	I'll be gettin' over you my whole life	Staring at the ceiling with you	Laughing with my feet in your lap	At the same time	Chasing that fame, he stayed the same	Some wannabe Z-lister	Good girl, sad boy	Passing by unbeknownst to me	Down deep inside your pocket	Tore your banners down, took the battle underground	They say looks can kill and I might try	Spit me out at the first chance	It's okay, we're the best of friends
	And by the way, I'm goin' out tonight		Dear reader, burn all the files		You said I was freeloading	Of everyone you burned just to get there		Oh, you don't ever say too much	Like you were my closest friend		All of me changed like midnight	And all the outfits were terrible	Big city, wrong choices	Life is emotionally abusive	We almost forgot it	And maybe it was egos swinging	I don't dress for women	And if I was some paint, did it splatter	Anyway
[Pre-Chorus]		[Chorus]	Desert all your past lives	[Chorus]	I didn't know you were keeping count	It's coming back around	[Pre-Chorus]	And you don't really read into	"How'd we end up on the floor, anyway?" you say	[Pre-Chorus]		2003 unbearable	We had one thing goin' on	And time can't stop me quite like you did	Does it ever miss Wicklow sometimes?	Maybe it was her	I don't dress for men	On a promising grown man?	I hear it in your voice, you're smoking with your boys
I should not be left to my own devices	[Chorus]	Goodbye, goodbye, goodbye	And if you don't recognize yourself	I think there's been a glitch, oh, yeah			You know how scared I am of elevators	My melancholia	"Your roommate's cheap-ass screw-top rosé, that's how"	And the touch of a hand lit the fuse	[Verse 1]	Did you see the photos?"	I swear that it was somethin'	And my flight was awful, thanks for asking	Ooh, ooh	Flashes of the battle come back to me in a blur	Lately, I've been dressin' for revenge	And if I was a child, did it matter	I touch my phone as if it's your face
They come with prices and vices	Best believe I'm still bejeweled	You were bigger than the whole sky	That means you did it right	Five seconds later, I'm fastening myself to you with a stitch, oh, yeah	[Chorus]	[Pre-Chorus]	Never trust it if it rises fast		I see you every day now	Of a chain reaction of countermoves	My town was a wasteland	No, I didn't, but thanks, though	'Cause I don't remember who I was	I'm unglued, thanks to you				If you got to wash your hands?	I didn't choose this town, I dream of getting out
I end up in crisis	When I walk in the room	You were more than just a short time		And I'm not even sorry, nights are so starry	High infidelity	And I keep my side of the street clean	It can't last	[Pre-Chorus]		To assess the equation of you	Full of cages, full of fences		Before you painted all my nights		[Chorus]	[Chorus]	[Chorus]		There's just one who could make me stay
(Tale as old as time)	I can still make the whole place shimmer	And I've got a lot to pine about	[Chorus]	Blood moonlit	Put on your records and regret me	You wouldn't know what I mean	[Chorus]	I been under scrutiny (Yeah, oh, yeah)	[Chorus]	Checkmate, I couldn't lose	Pageant queens and big pretenders	[Pre-Chorus]	A color I've searched for since	[Chorus: Taylor Swift, Taylor Swift & Lana Del Rey]	They said the end is comin'	All that bloodshed, crimson clover	I don't start shit, but I can tell you how it ends	[Pre-Chorus]	All my days
I wake up screaming from dreaming	And when I meet the band	I've got a lot to live without	Never take advice from someone who's falling apart	It must be counterfeit	I bent the truth too far tonight	[Chorus]	Uh-oh, I'm fallin' in love	You handle it beautifully (Yeah, oh, yeah)	And I chose you	[Chorus]	But for some, it was paradise	I'm so in love that I might stop breathing	But one thing after another	And it's like snow at the beach	Everyone’s up to somethin'	Uh-huh, sweet dream was over	Don't get sad, get even	Ooh, all I used to do was pray	[Pre-Chorus]
One day, I'll watch as you're leaving	They ask, "Do you have a man?"	I'm never gonna meet	Never take advice from someone who's falling apart (You should find another)	I think there's been a glitch, oh, yeah	I was dancing around, dancing around it	'Cause karma is my boyfriend	Oh no, I'm fallin' in love again	All this shit is new to me (Yeah, oh, yeah)	The one I was dancing with	What if I told you none of it was accidental?	My boy was a montage	Drew a map on your bedroom ceiling	Fuckin' situations, circumstances	Weird, but fuckin' beautiful	I find myself runnin' home to your sweet nothings	My hand was the one you reached for	So on the weekends	Would've, could've, should've	From sprinkler splashes to fireplace ashes
'Cause you got tired of my scheming	I could still say, "I don't remember"	What could've been, would've been	[Verse 2]	[Verse 2]	High infidelity	Karma is a god	Oh, I'm fallin' in love	[Chorus]	In New York, no shoes	And the first night that you saw me	A slow-motion, love potion	No, I didn't see the news	Miscommunications, and I	Flying in a dream	Outside, they’re push and shovin'	All throughout the Great War	I don't dress for friends	If you'd never looked my way	I waited ages to see you there
(For the last time)	Familiarity breeds contempt	What should've been you	Dear reader, bend when you can	I was supposed to sweat you out	Put on your headphones and burn my city	Karma is the breeze in my hair on the weekend	I thought the plane was goin' down	I feel the lavender haze creeping up on me	Looked up at the sky and it was	Nothing was gonna stop me	Jumping off things in the ocean	'Cause we were somewhere else	Have to say, by the way	Stars by the pocketful	You're in the kitchen hummin'	Always remember	Lately, I've been dressin' for revenge	[Chorus]	I search the party of better bodies
[Chorus]	Don't put mе in the basement	What could've been, would've been you	Snap when you have to	In search of glorious happenings of happenstance on someone else's playground	Your picket fence is sharp as knives	Karma's a relaxing thought	How'd you turn it right around?	Surreal	The burgundy on my t-shirt	I laid the groundwork, and then	I broke his heart 'cause he was nice	Stumbled down pretend alleyways	I just may like some explanations	You wanting me	All that you ever wanted from me was sweet nothin'	Uh-huh, tears on the lеtter	[Verse 2]	I would've stayed on my knees	Just to learn that you never cared
It's me, hi	Whеn I want the penthouse of your heart	[Verse 2]	Dear reader, you don't have to answer	But it's been two-thousand one-hundred ninety days of our love blackout	I was dancing around, dancing around it	Aren't you envious that for you it's not?		I'm damned if I do give a damn what people say	When you splashed your wine into me	Just like clockwork	He was sunshine, I was midnight rain	Cheap wine, make believe it's champagne	[Chorus]	Tonight feels impossible	[Verse 2]	I vowed not to cry anymore	She needed cold, hard proof, so I gave her some	And I damn sure never would've danced with the devil	
I'm the problem, it's me	Diamonds in my eyes	Did some bird flap its wings ovеr in Asia?	Just 'cause they asked you	(Our love is blacking out)	[Refrain]	Sweet like honey, karma is a cat	[Verse 2]	No deal	And how the blood rushed into my cheeks	The dominoes cascaded in a line	[Chorus]	I was taken by the view	Can I ask you a question?	But it's comin' down	On the way home	If wе survived the Great War	She had the envelope, where you think she got it from?	At nineteen	[Chorus]
At teatime, everybody agrees	I polish up real, I polish up real nice	Did some force take you bеcause I didn't pray?	(You should find another)	The system's breaking down	Do you really wanna know where I was April 29th?	Purring in my lap 'cause it loves me	It only feels this raw right now	The 1950s shit they want from me	So scarlet, it was	What if I told you I'm a mastermind?	He wanted it comfortable, I wanted that pain	[Chorus]	Did you ever have someone kiss you in a crowded room	No sound, it's all around	I wrote a poem	[Verse 2]	Now she gets the house, gets the kids, gets the pride	And the God's honest truth is that the pain was heaven	You're on your own, kid
I'll stare directly at the sun, but never in the mirror	[Post-Chorus]	Every single thing to come has turned into ashes	Dear reader, the greatest of luxuries is your secrets	(The system's breaking down)	Do I really have to chart the constellations in his eyes?	Flexing like a goddamn acrobat	Lost in the labyrinth of my mind	I just wanna stay in that lavender haze	The mark thеy saw on my collarbone	And now you're mine	He wanted a bride, I was making my own name	Like we were in Paris	And every single one of your friends was makin' fun of you	[Post-Chorus: Taylor Swift, Lana Del Rey]	You say, "What a mind"	You drew up some good faith treaties	Picture me thick as thieves with your ex-wife	And now that I'm grown, I'm scared of ghosts	You always have been
It must be exhausting always rooting for the anti-hero	Nice	'Cause it's all over, it's not meant to be	Dear reader, when you aim at the devil			Me and karma vibe like that	Break up, break free, break through, break down		The rust that grew bеtween telephones	It was all by dеsign	Chasing that fame, he stayed the same	Like we were somewhere else	But fifteen seconds later, thеy were clappin' too?	Like snow on the beach	This happens all the time	I drew curtains closed, drank my poison all alone	And she looks so pretty	Memories feel like weapons	
		So I'll say words I don't believe	Make sure you don't miss	[Chorus]	[Verse 2]		You would break your back to make me break a smile	[Verse 2]	The lips I used to call home	'Cause I'm a mastermind	All of me changed like midnight	Like we were in Paris, oh	Then what did you do?	Like snow on the beach	Ooh, ooh	You said I have to trust more freely	Drivin' in your Benz	And now that I know, I wish you'd left me wondering	[Verse 2]
[Verse 2]	[Verse 2]			I think there's been a glitch, oh, yeah	Storm coming, good husband	[Verse 2]		All they keep asking me (All they keep asking me)	So scarlet, it was maroon			We were somewhere else	Did you lеave her house in the middle of the night? Oh	Like snow on the beach		But diesel is desire, you were playing with fire	Lately, she's been dressin' for revenge		I see the great escape, so long, Daisy May
Sometimes, I feel like everybody is a sexy baby	Baby boy, I think I've been too good of a girl (Too good of a girl)	[Chorus]	[Chorus]	Five seconds later, I'm fastening myself to you with a stitch, oh, yeah	Bad omen	Spiderboy, king of thieves	[Pre-Chorus]	Is if I'm gonna be your bride	[Verse 2]	[Verse 2]	[Verse 2]		Did you wish you'd put up more of a fight, oh	Like snow, ah	[Chorus]	And maybe it's the past that's talking		[Verse 2]	I picked the petals, he loves me not
And I'm a monster on the hill	Did all the extra credit, then got graded on a curve	Goodbye, goodbye, goodbye	Never take advice from someone who's falling apart	And I'm not even sorry, nights are so starry	Dragged my feet right down the aisle	Weave your little webs of opacity	You know how much I hate	The only kinda girl they see (Only kinda girl they see)	When the silence came	You see, all the wisеst women	It came like a postcard	[Verse 2]	When she said it was too much?		'Causе they said the end is comin'	Screaming from the crypt	[Chorus]	If you never touched me, I would've	Something different bloomed, writing in my room
Too big to hang out, slowly lurching toward your favorite city	I think it's time to teach some lessons	You were bigger than the whole sky	Never take advice from someone who's falling apart	Blood moonlit	At the house lonely, good money	My pennies made your crown	That everybody just expects me to bounce back	Is a one-night or a wife	We were shaking, blind and hazy	Had to do it this way	Picture perfect shiny family	Privacy sign on the door	Do you wish you could still touch her?	[Verse 2: Taylor Swift, Taylor Swift & Lana Del Rey]	Evеryone's up to somethin’	Telling me to punish you for things you never did	She don't start shit, but she can tell you how it ends	Gone along with the righteous	I play my songs in the parking lot
Pierced through the heart, but never killed	I made you my world (Huh), have you heard? (Huh)	You were more than just a short time		It must be counterfeit	I'd pay if you'd just know me	Trick me once, trick me twice	Just like that		How the hell did we lose sight of us again?	'Cause we were born to be the pawn	Holiday peppermint candy	And on my page and on the whole world	It's just a question	This scene feels like what I once saw on a screen	I find myself runnin’ home to your sweet nothings	So I justified it	Don't get sad, get even	If I never blushed, then they could've	I'll run away
	I can reclaim the land	And I've got a lot to pine about	[Bridge]	I think there's been a glitch	Seemed like the right thing at the time	Don't you know that cash ain't the only price?		[Pre-Chorus]	Sobbing with your head in your hands	In every lover's game	But for him, it's every day	Romance is not dead if you keep it just yours		I searched "aurora borealis green"	Outside, they're push and shovin’		So on the weekends	Never whispered about this	
[Pre-Chorus]	And I miss you (Miss you), but I miss sparklin' (Nice)	I've got a lot to live without	So I wander through these nights			It's coming back around	[Chorus]	I find it dizzying (Yeah, oh, yeah)	Ain't that the way shit always ends?		So I peered through a window	Levitate above all the messes made	[Verse 2]	I've never seen someone lit from within	You're in the kitchen hummin'	[Chorus]	She don't dress for friends	And if you never saved me from boredom	[Pre-Chorus]
Did you hear my covert narcissism I disguise as altruism		I'm never gonna meet	I prefer hiding in plain sight	[Bridge]	[Refrain]		Uh-oh, I'm fallin' in love	They're bringing up my history (Yeah, oh, yeah)	You were standing hollow-eyed in the hallway	[Pre-Chorus]	A deep portal, time travel	Sit quiet by my side in the shade	Half-moon eyes, bad surprise	Blurring out my periphery	All that you ever wanted from me was nothin'	All that bloodshed, crimson clover	Lately, she's been dressing for revenge	I could've gone on as I was	From sprinkler splashes to fireplace ashes
Like some kind of congressman?	[Chorus]	What could've been, would've been	My fourth drink in my hand	A brief interruption, a slight malfunction	You know there's many different ways that you can kill the one you love	[Pre-Chorus]	Oh no, I'm fallin' in love again	But you weren't even listening (Yeah, oh, yeah)	Carnations you had thought were roses, that's us	If you fail to plan, you plan to fail	All the love we unravel	And not the kind that's thrown	Did you realize out of time?	My smile is like I won a contest		Uh-huh, the bombs were closer		But, Lord, you made me feel important	I called a taxi to take me there
(A tale as old as time)	Best believe I'm still bejeweled	What should've been you	These desperate prayers of a cursed man	I'd go back to wanting dudes who give nothing	The slowest way is never loving them enough	And I keep my side of the street clean	Oh, I'm fallin' in love		I feel you, no matter what	Strategy sets the scene for the tale	And the life I gave away	I mean, the kind under where a tree has grown	She was on your mind with some dickhead guy	And to hide that would be so dishonest	[Bridge]	My hand was the one you reached for	[Bridge]	And then you tried to erase us	I search the party of better bodies
I wake up screaming from dreaming	When I walk in the room		Spilling out to you for free	I thought we had no chance	Do you really wanna know where I was April 29th?	You wouldn't know what I mean	I thought the plane was goin' down	[Chorus]	The rubies that I gave up	I'm the wind in our free-flowing sails	'Cause he was sunshine, I was midnight rain		That you saw that night	And it's fine to fake it 'til you make it	Industry disruptors and soul deconstructors	All throughout the Great War	Ladies always rise above		Just to learn that my dreams aren't rare
One day, I'll watch as you're leaving	I can still make the whole place shimmer	[Bridge]	But darling, darling, please	And that's romance, let's dance	Do I really have to tell you how he brought me back to life?		How'd you turn it right around?	I feel the lavender haze creepin' up on me		And the liquor in our cocktails		[Pre-Chorus]	But you were on somethin'	'Til you do, 'til it's true	And smooth-talking hucksters out glad-handing each other	Always remember	Ladies know what people want	[Pre-Chorus]	
And life will lose all its meaning	And when I meet the band	What could've been, would've been you	You wouldn't take my word for it if you knew who was talking			[Chorus]	Uh-oh, I'm fallin' in love	Surreal	[Chorus]		[Chorus]	I'm so in love that I might stop breathing	It was one drink after another		And the voices that implore, "You should be doing more"	Uh-huh, the burning embers	Someone sweet and kind and fun	Ooh, you're a crisis of my faith	[Chorus]
(For the last time)	They ask, "Do you have a man?"	What could've been, would've been	If you knew where I was walking	[Chorus]	[Chorus]	'Cause karma is my boyfriend	Oh no, I'm fallin' in love again	I'm damned if I do give a damn what people say	And I lost you	[Chorus]	He wanted it comfortable, I wanted that pain	Drew a map on your bedroom ceiling	Fuckin' politics and gender roles	[Chorus: Taylor Swift & Lana Del Rey]	To you, I can admit that I’m just too soft for all of it	I vowed not to fight anymore	The lady simply had enough	Would've, could've, should've	You're on your own, kid
	I could still say, "I don't remember"	What should've been you	To a house, not a home, all alone 'cause nobody's there	Glitch, oh, yeah	High infidelity	Karma is a god	Oh, I'm fallin' in love	No deal	The one I was dancing with	What if I told you none of it was accidental?	He wanted a bride, I was making my own name	No, I didn't see the news	And you're not sure and I don't know	Now it's like snow at the beach	Ooh	If we survived the Great War		If I'd only played it safe	You always have been
[Chorus]	Familiarity breeds contempt	What could've been, would've been you	Where I pace in my pen and my friends found friends who care	Five seconds later, I'm fastening myself to you with a stitch, oh, yeah	Put on your records and regret me	Karma is the breeze in my hair on the weekend	I thought the plane was goin' down	The 1950s shit they want from me	In New York, no shoes	And the first night that you saw me	Chasing that fame, he stayed the same	'Cause we were somewhere else	Got swept away in the gray	Weird, but fuckin' beautiful			[Verse 3]		You might also like[Instrumental Break]

I just wanna stay in that lavender haze	Looked up at the sky and it was (Maroon)	I knew I wanted your body	All of me changed like midnight rain	Stumbled down pretend alleyways	I just may like to have a conversation	Flying in a dream	[Chorus]	[Post-Chorus]	While he was doin' lines and crossin' all of mine	[Chorus]

You're in the kitchen hummin' (You're in the kitchen hummin')	I really thought I'd lost you		The tomb won't close	Everything you lose is a step you take
It's me, hi	And we're dancin' all night				[Chorus]	[Breakdown]		Get it off my desk	That's a real fucking legacy, legacy (It was maroon)	This is the first time I've felt the need to confess	And I never think of him	I wanna transport you	It's just a question	[Bridge: Taylor Swift, Taylor Swift & Lana Del Rey]	All that you ever wanted from me was sweet nothin'You might also like22Embed	You might also like[Verse 3]		Stained glass windows in my mind	So, make the friendship bracelets, take the moment and taste it
I'm the problem, it's me	And you can try to change my mind				High infidelity	'Cause karma is the thunder			And I wake with your memory over me	And I swear	Except on midnights like this	To somewhere the culture's clever	You might also like[Bridge]	I (I) can't (Can't) speak, afraid to jinx it		We can plant a memory garden		I regret you all the time	You've got no reason to be afraid
It's me, hi	But you might have to wait in line				Put on your records and regret meeting me	Rattling your ground		[Chorus]	That's a real fucking legacy to leave	I'm only cryptic and Machiavellian	(Midnights like this, midnights like this)29Embed	Confess my truth	Does it feel like everything's just like	I (I) don't (Don't) even dare to wish it		Say a solemn prayer, place a poppy in my hair		I can't let this go	
I'm the problem, it's me	What's a girl gonna do?				I bent the truth too far tonight	Karma's on your scent like a bounty hunter		I feel (I feel), the lavender haze creeping up on me	You might also like[Chorus]	'Cause I care		In swooping, sloping, cursive letters	Second best after that meteor strike?	But your eyes are flying saucers from another planet		There's no morning glory, it was war, it wasn't fair		I fight with you in my sleep	[Chorus]
It's me, hi	A diamond's gotta shine				I was dancing around, dancing around it	Karma's gonna track you down		Surreal	The burgundy on my t-shirt			Let the only flashing lights be the tower at midnight	And what's that that I heard? That you're still with her?	Now I'm all for you like Janet		And we will never go back		The wound won't close	You're on your own, kid
Everybody agrees, everybody agrees					High infidelity	Step by step, from town to town		I'm damned if I do give a damn what people say	When you splashed your wine into me	[Chorus]		In my mind	That's nice, I'm sure that's what's suitable	Can this be a real thing? Can it?				I keep on waiting for a sign	Yeah, you can face this
	[Chorus]				Put on your headphones and burn my city	Sweet like justice, karma is a queen		No deal (No deal)	And how the blood rushed into my cheeks	So I told you none of it was accidental			And right, but tonight			[Chorus]		I regret you all the time	You're on your own, kid
[Chorus]	Best believe I'm still bejeweled				Your picket fence is sharp as knives	Karma takes all my friends to the summit		The 1950s shit they want from me	So scarlet, it was maroon	And the first night that you saw me		[Breakdown]		[Chorus: Taylor Swift & Lana Del Rey, Taylor Swift]		To that bloodshed, crimson clover			You always have been40Embed
It's me, hi (Hi)	When I walk in the room				I was dancing around, dancing around it	Karma is the guy on the screen		I just wanna stay in that lavender haze	The mark they saw on my collarbone	Nothing was gonna stop me		We drew a map on your bedroom ceiling	[Chorus]	Are we falling like snow at the beach? (Snow at the beach)		Uh-huh, the worst was over		[Verse 3]	
I'm the problem, it's me (I'm the problem, it's me)	I can still make the whole place shimmer (Shimmer)					Coming straight home to me			The rust that grew between telephones	I laid the groundwork, and then		No, I didn't see the news	Can I ask you a question? (Can I ask you a question?)	Weird, but fuckin' beautiful		My hand was the one you reached for		If clarity's in death, then why won't this die?	
At teatime (Teatime), everybody agrees (Everybody agrees)	And when I meet the band				[Non-Lyrical Break]			[Outro]	The lips I used to call home	Saw a wide smirk on your face		'Cause we were somewhere else	Did you ever have someone kiss you in a crowded room (In a crowded room)	Flying in a dream (Flying in a dream)		All throughout the Great War		Years of tearing down our banners, you and I	
I'll stare directly at the sun, but never in the mirror	They ask, "Do you have a man?"					[Chorus]		Get it off your chest	So scarlet, it was maroon	You knew the entire time		In an alleyway, drinking champagne	And every single one of your friends was makin' fun of you (Makin' fun of you)	Stars by the pocketful		Always remember		Living for the thrill of hitting you where it hurts	
It must be exhausting always rooting for the anti-hero64Embed	I could still say, "I don't remember"				[Post-Chorus]	'Cause karma is my boyfriend (Karma is my boyfriend)		Get it off my desk		You knew that I'm a mastermind			But fifteen seconds later, they were clappin' too?	You wanting me (You wanting me)		Uh-huh, we're burned for better		Give me back my girlhood, it was mine first	
	Familiarity breeds contempt				Oh, there's many different ways that you can kill the one you love	Karma is a god		That lavender haze	[Outro]	And now you're mine		[Chorus]	Then what did you do? (Do)	Tonight feels impossible		I vowed I would always be yours			
	Don't put me in the basement				And it's never enough, it's never enough	Karma is the breeze in my hair on the weekend (Weekend)		I just wanna stay	It was maroon	Yeah, all you did was smile		'Cause we were in Paris	Did you leave her house in the middle of the night? Oh	But it's comin' down		'Cause we survived the Great War		[Chorus]	
	When I want the penthouse of your heart					Karma's a relaxing thought		I just wanna stay in that lavender haze35Embed	It was maroon34Embed	'Cause I'm a mastermind25Embed		Yes, we were somewhere else	Did you wish you'd put up more of a fight, oh (More of a fight)	No sound, it's all around				And I damn sure never would've danced with the devil	
	Diamonds in my eyes				[Outro]	Aren't you envious that for you it's not?						My love, we were in Paris	When she said it was too much?			[Outro]		At nineteen	
	I polish up real (Nice), I polish up real nice				Lock broken, slur spoken	Sweet like honey, karma is a cat						Yes, we were somewhere else15Embed	Do you wish you could still touch her?	[Post-Chorus: Taylor Swift, Lana Del Rey]		Uh-huh, uh-huh		And the God's honest truth is that the pain was heaven	
					Wound open, game token	Purring in my lap 'cause it loves me							It's just a question21Embed	Like snow on the beach (Snow on the beach)		I will always be yours		And now that I'm grown, I'm scared of ghosts	
	[Outro]				I didn't know you were keeping count	Flexing like a goddamn acrobat								Like snow on the beach (Flying in a dream)		'Cause we survived the Great War		Memories feel like weapons	
	And we're dancin' all night				Rain soaking, blind hoping	Me and karma vibe like that								Like snow on the beach (You wanting me)		Uh-huh		And now that I know, I wish you'd left me wondering	
	And you can try to change my mind				You said I was freeloading	[Outro]								Like snow, ah		I vow I will always be yours27Embed		[Outro]	
	But you might have to wait in line				I didn't know you were keeping count	Karma is my boyfriend								But it's comin' down				God rest my soul	
	What's a girl gonna do? What's a girl gonna do?				But, oh, you were keeping count13Embed	Karma is a god (Ah)								No sound, it's all around				I miss who I used to be	
	I polish up nice					Uh-huh, mm								[Outro: Taylor Swift]				The tomb won't close
